    <!-- About the Huemul-->

    <section class="about-huemul">
        <h3>The Huemul</h3>
        <p>The huemul deer <i>(Hippocamelus bisulcus)</i>, also known as the South Andean deer, is the iconic animal of Chile. A huemul even appears alongside the condor in the country’s coat of arms, and they were named a natural national monument in 2006.
        </p>
        <p>Once a common inhabitant of both the Chilean and Argentinian sides of the Andean mountain range, huemul territory used to stretch from Santiago right down to the Straits of Aysen and Magellan, but it is now rapidly shrinking. There are an estimated
            2,000 left in the wild, with roughly 1,500 in Chile, and 500 or so wandering the mountains of Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>. Patagonia offers the best chance to spot a South American huemul Although they’re known to inhabit parts of Chile from Chillán southwards, as well as the southwestern stretch of Argentina, your best bet for seeing huemul is along the shores
            of Lago Cochrane and in Tamango National Reservs Conservacion Patagonica have recently established protected habitats for this endangered species in these regions. The rugged, barely-hospitable terrain of the Andean mountains has required
            the South Andean huemul to physically adapt to the challenges of its habitat. Occupying areas from sea-level up to 5500 feet (1,700m) of elevation, it has developed short legs and a stocky build to help it climb over this rough terrain. The
            coloring of its coat also enables it to blend into its surroundings, which are normally forests of southern beech or dense shrubland. The Chile national animal is at risk of extinction Although once prolific throughout the Andean region of
            Chile and Argentina, the population of South Andean huemul has been dwindling rapidly. Since 1982, it has been registered as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Estimates suggest thatonly 1500 animals remain, two-thirds
            of which are thought to reside in Chile. 7. Its predators are responsible for its rapidly declining population Predators of the huemul include pumas, culpeo foxes and domestic dogs. However, by far its most significant predator has been humans.
            Since settlers arrived in Patagonia in the 19th-century, they have played a fundamental role in seriously reducing the global population of this species. 8. Protecting the South Andean huemul has finally become a priority Argentina has faced
            extreme criticism for not recognising the potential threat of extinction facing the Chile national animal. It is only since 2010 that both Chile and Argentina have taken to working cooperatively to prevent the tiny population of of South Andean
            huemul from dwindling any further. Measures aimed at addressing illegal hunting and habitat degradation, amongst other critical threats, have been introduced to tackle the issue, and both countries hope to bring this emblematic creature back
            from the brink of extinction.

    <section class="what-we-do">
        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <p> This initiative will evaluate the potential risks to the Huemul and, consequently, the rest of the area’s biodiversity. The highest risk is from economic activities on private lands, specifically development, livestock raising and logging. The
            project will focus on scientific field research, the establishment of relationships with landowners in the region, and a local education and awareness campaign. The results of these three main objectives will be used to realize the fourth
            and ultimate objective--a Conservation Action Plan for the focal area.</p>
