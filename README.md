# The Huemul Organization

User-Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute .

This is The Huemul Organization website, which first objective is to present the South Andean Deer, the huemul to the world. The project wants to create a bond between the user and this endangered animal, to get donations to keep researching and educating the population to preserve the huemul in the Magallanes Region, Chile.

## UX

My goal was to create a responsive Single-Page Application, easy to read and understand. The color scheme was taken from the predominant colors in the "Home" section picture. I have pictures of the huemul habitat between sections to create a pause between content, I have also chosen some touching quotes from famous relevant people from the conservationist field about education and wildlife conservation as a message that we still have a chance to make the world a better place to live.
The sections I created for the website are:

### Home:
I wanted to have a picture of the huemul and his environment and a message, to catch the user with in nice landing page.
### What we do:
In this section I wanted to provide the user with information about what our organization does, what our main and ultimate objectives are.
### About the huemul:
The goal of this section is to give context to our organization, I wanted to have a brief summary with the most important information about the huemul. I considered as relevant information: what a huemul is, where they live, conservation state, cause of its endangered state, and to show that its conservation has become a priority in both sides of the Andes.
### News:
I considered that it was necessary to have a "news" section, where the user could have the latest news about the huemul linked to external websites.
### Donation:
It was necessary to implement a donation section, as one of our important incomes is from the people that want to help our organization.
### Contact:
This section is necessary for the users to contact us, in case they want to help in any other way such as volunteering, internships or in case they need us to make an education session for students or any specific public.


## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (4.3.1)
- Font Awesome 4.7.0
- Google Fonts


## Features
This site is a Single-page application, with collapsable navbar on the mobile versions featured in Bootstrap. 


### Features left to implement
In the future, I would like to implement the Element Fade In on Scroll function, to create movement and make the website less static. I would also like to implement a Spanish Version, so people in Chile can understand the meaning of this website.

## Testing
Since I started the project and after every modification I have tested the website for mobile devices and desktop using Chrome Dev Tool. 
Once I finished the sections, I tested for every link I have clicking on them.
To test user experience I sent the link of the project to my family and friends, they seemed to enjoy the website, my non-Chilean friends know what a huemul is now.
I validated the HTML code using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

## Deployment
This website is hosted and deployed using GitHub pages. The link to my website is: [The Huemul Organization](http://elisamunoz.github.io/the-huemul-organization/)

## Credits
The main inspiration I got was from [The Gorilla Organization](https://www.gorillas.org/) and [The WWF Organization](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) websites. I also get so see many different websites (good and bad) at work, where I got some ideas about what I wanted and what I did not want to implement on my own website.
All the information about the huemul and the penguin favicon were taken from the [Australis](https://blogpatagonia.australis.com/8-facts-chile-national-animal/) and from [Cascada Travel](https://www.cascada.travel/en/News/Huemul-Chiles-National-Animal) websites.
