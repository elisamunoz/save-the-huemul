# The Huemul Organization

User-Centric Frontend Development Project - Code Institute .

This is The Huemul Organization website, which first objective is to present the South Andean Deer, the huemul to the world. The project wants to create a bond between the user and this endangered animal, to get donations to keep researching and educating the population to preserve the huemul in the Magallanes Region, Chile.

## UX

My goal was to create a responsive Single-Page Application, easy to use and understand. The color scheme was taken from the predominant colors in the "Home" section picture. I have chosen some touching quotes from famous people about education and wildlife conservation as a message that we still have a chance to make the world a better place to live.
For the users, I wanted to provide them with a website where they can learn about our organization, to know the huemul, to get the latest news about the huemul, to donate to help continue with our work and a section to contact our organization.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (4.3.1)
- Font Awesome 4.7.0
- Google Fonts


## Features
This site is a Single-page application, with collapsable navbar on the mobile versions featured in Bootstrap. 


### Features left to implement
In the future, I would like to implement the Element Fade In on Scroll function, to create movement and make the website less static. I would also like to implement a Spanish Version, so people in Chile can understand the meaning of this website.

## Testing
Since I started the project and after every modification I have tested the website for mobile devices and desktop using Chrome Dev Tool. 
Once I finished the sections, I tested for every link I have clicking on them.
To test user experience I sent the link of the project to my family and friends, they seemed to enjoy the website, my non-Chilean friends know what a huemul is now.
I validated the HTML code using [The W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

## Deployment
This website is hosted and deployed using GitHub pages. The link to my website is: [The Huemul Organization](http://elisamunoz.github.io/the-huemul-organization/)

## Credits
The main inspiration I got was from [The Gorilla Organization](https://www.gorillas.org/) and [The WWF Organization](https://www.worldwildlife.org/) websites. I also get so see many different websites (good and bad) at work, where I got some ideas about what I wanted and what I did not want to implement on my own website.
All the information about the huemul and the penguin favicon were taken from the [Australis](https://blogpatagonia.australis.com/8-facts-chile-national-animal/) and from [Cascada Travel](https://www.cascada.travel/en/News/Huemul-Chiles-National-Animal) websites.
