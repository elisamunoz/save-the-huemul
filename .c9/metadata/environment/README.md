The project wants to create a bond between the user and this endangered animal, to get donations to keep researching and educating the population to preserve the huemul in the Magallanes Region, Chile.","","## UX","","My goal was to create a responsive Single-Page Application, easy to use and understand. The color scheme was taken from the predominant colors in the \"Home\" section picture. I have chosen some touching quotes from famous people about education and wildlife conservation as a message that we still have a chance to make the world a better place to live.","For the users, I wanted to provide them with a website where they can learn about our organization, to know the huemul, to get the latest news about the huemul, to donate to help continue with our work and a section to contact our organization.","","## Technologies","","- HTML","- CSS","- Bootstrap (4.3.1)","- Font Awesome 4.7.0","- Google Fonts","","","## Features","This site is a Single-page application, with collapsable navbar on the mobile versions featured in Bootstrap.
